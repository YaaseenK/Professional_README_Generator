  # Professional README Generator
  
  ## Description 
   * Motivation:
    I was motivated to build a readme generator because my peers and I have built so many readMe.md files during the duration of this course and we will probably have to build countless more for the duration of the course. My future sight motivated me to build this application for myself and my peers.
   * Build information:
    I built this project to save my peers from repeating the same process over and over.
   * Problem and solutions:
    Create a quick and easy solution to building an high-quality README
   * Knowledge:
    Use of packages for the app // exporting moduals
